<p>In late December Tesla pushed out a new major update to my Model Y dubbed <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-software-v11-0">&ldquo;version 11.0&rdquo;</a> which included a revamped UI and a bunch of new features.  Probably the coolest feature released was the Light Show which allows creators to use a sequence show tool called xLights to turn on/off or ramp various lights, open/close the windows, open/close the trunk, etc.  They also included a default light show which at the time was holiday themed that got a good reaction by friends/family, pretty sweet to get OTA updates on a car right?  Anyways I finally got around to building a custom light show and figured I would take notes as I went and write about it in case others find it interesting and would like to do the same.</p>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>The Tesla engineering team put together a great readme and linting tool which they published under the <code>teslamotors</code> Github organization <a href="https://github.com/teslamotors/light-show">here</a>.  It covered most of the details I needed as long as I was willing to jump around a bit as I progressed.</p>
<h3 id="installed-software">Installed software</h3>
<p>Once I read through the documentation I went ahead and installed the xLights application using the Apple app store on my Mac.  <strong>Note</strong> that xLights supports all the major OS platforms, see the <a href="https://xlights.org/releases/">download page</a>.</p>
<p>I then downloaded the sequenece model the Tesla engineering team created and provided a link to in this <a href="https://github.com/teslamotors/light-show#getting-started-with-the-tesla-xlights-project-directory">section</a> of the readme and imported it into xLights.  This pulls in the 3D car model with the 46 channels (lights, windows, doors, etc) that are configurable and provides a nice visual layout when testing out the light show in xLights.</p>
<p><img src="/x-lights-overview.png" alt="xLights Overview"></p>
<h3 id="test-out-the-example-sequence">Test out the example sequence</h3>
<p>The Tesla engineering team provided an example <a href="https://github.com/teslamotors/light-show#opening-the-example-sequence">light show</a> (not the same one loaded in the car) which you can use to get a feel for how the sequence effects are laid out and validate your USB can be plugged into the car and correctly play a custom light show.  I found this step useful to ensure I didn&rsquo;t take the time to create a light show from scratch and end up running into an issue with USB disk format, etc.</p>
<p>I downloaded the example, put it into <code>Downloads-&gt;Tesla_Light_Show-&gt;Smooth_Jazz-&gt;LightShow</code>, copied that folder over to the USB, plugged it into the car and tested it out.  Thankfully it worked the first time!  <strong>Note</strong> that I had to wait for a progress bar at the bottom of the modal to complete before pressing play or it would play the last loaded light show.</p>
<h3 id="creating-my-own-light-show">Creating my own light show</h3>
<p>First I needed the audio file for the song I wanted to play.  It is surprisingly hard nowadays with streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, etc. to just get a plain old mp3 anymore&hellip; but Amazon Music to the rescue!  In a couple clicks I found the song, purchased the single and downloaded the mp3 file into a new folder under <code>Downloads-&gt;Tesla_Light_Show-&gt;Bang-&gt;LightShow</code>.</p>
<p>Now this is where the fun part actually begins, I needed to create the .fseq file using xLights which contains all the effects matched up to the audio.  To do this I opened xLights, created a new sequence and imported the mp3 file.  I put on some headphones and proceeded to try and grok the xLights interface and add effects 10-15 seconds at a time.  Once I had a good chunk added I would play it back and modify the effects until they lined up with the audio (or close enough!).  Once I got through the first chorus, verse and bridge I was able to start chunking the sequences with copy/paste.  I would then overlay some additional effects to build the light show as it progressed through the song.</p>
<p>According to the Tesla light show readme there is a max of 651 effects allowed and so they wrote a python validator script to help sequence authors figure out if they were within the parameters.  Once I completed the light show and saved the .fseq file to the LightShow folder I ran that tool.  Apparently I had a lot more effects I could still add, maybe I will revist this sequence again another time.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">   $ python validator.py ~/Downloads/Tesla_Shows/Bang/LightShow/lightshow.fseq

│   ├── lightshow.fseq
│   ├── lightshow.mp3
│   ├── lightshow.xsq
</code></pre></div><p>And this is a preview of how the light show turned out.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-SK5_alK1A" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>I spent probably about 4 hours getting from no idea how to create a light show for my car to understanding and creating one from scratch so kudos to the Tesla engineering team for good documentation and picking a tool (xLights) that has a decent interface for creating a sequence.  I had a blast creating this light show and intend to create more in the future that makes full use of the advanced effects including tailgate open/close and light ramping.</p>
<p>One final note is it did occur to me that it would be nice to have a single USB with multiple custom light shows and the display would provide a picker with the list of shows available.  I filed a Github RFE which was promptly closed as a dupe of <a href="https://github.com/teslamotors/light-show/issues/8">#8</a>.  When I took a look at that issue it appears the team appreciated the suggestions but did not commit to implementing it.  So a typical Tesla response.</p>
<h3 id="additional-resources">Additional resources</h3>
<p>Below are some cool resources I discovered before/during/after building the light show and I will keep this list up to date as I find more.</p>
